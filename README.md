# GitHub Dark Themes for Typora

Hi folks! In this repo, you'll find GitHub Dark Default, Dark Dimmed, and Dark High-Contrast themes for Typora.\
These themes are based on Kinoute's [GitHub Night Themes for Typora](https://github.com/kinoute/typora-github-night-theme). Still, they have undergone significant enhancements, such as using `system-ui` as a font instead of Nunito, for a pure GitHub experience. Additionally, the themes have undergone further improvements like enhanced code block border-radius, colors, list spacing, text line height, font weight, and checkboxes, among other enhancements.
