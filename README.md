# GitHub Dark Themes for Typora

Hi folks! In this repo, you'll find GitHub Dark Default, Dark Dimmed, and Dark High-Contrast themes for Typora.\
These themes are based on Kinoute's [GitHub Night Themes for Typora](https://github.com/kinoute/typora-github-night-theme). But there are a lot of improvements, such as the use of the font: instead of Nunito, they all use `system-ui` (as GitHub does), so you'll feel at home whatever your platform is. I've also made improvements such as better-rounded corners for code blocks, and more accurate colors.
